# Personalized Healthcare Recommendations â€“ A Machine Learning Approach

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether an individual is likely to donate blood again, based on historical donation behavior. The system acts like a healthcare recommendation engine by identifying high-risk drop-offs and providing insights to re-engage potential donors.

## Problem Statement

The objective is to use past donation data to:
- Predict future blood donation behavior
- Recommend personalized engagement strategies
- Help healthcare organizations retain consistent donors

---

## Dataset Overview

- **Source:** Public datasets, surveys, and donor records
- **Entries:** 548
- **Features:** Recency, Frequency, Monetary, Time
- **Target:** `Class` (1 = will donate again, 0 = will not)

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- ~75% of users did not donate again (imbalanced dataset)
- Frequency and Monetary had strong positive correlation
- Recent, frequent donors were more likely to return

---

## Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values
- Applied **StandardScaler** for normalization
- Used **Stratified Train-Test Split** (80/20) to maintain class distribution

---

## Model Training

- **Model:** Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Result:** ~77% Accuracy, balanced metrics

ðŸ“Œ *Classification logic:*
- `Class 1` â†’ Likely to donate again
- `Class 0` â†’ Unlikely to donate again

---

## Recommendation Logic

Used model predictions to simulate a recommendation engine:
- Engage likely donors with thank-you emails
- Follow up with lower-likelihood donors via educational outreach
- Prioritize frequent contributors for future drives

from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Example model and evaluation (pseudocode)
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
